**NOTE:** *THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND IS NOT READY FOR GAMEPLAY YET.*

**This project is going through a rework. Lots of things are broken and might not even compile right now. If you want to try out the last working Debug version, check out the master branch.**

# eSports Manager

**eSports Manager** aims to become a free and open source eSports management game, licensed under the [GPLv3](LICENSE.md), based on titles like Football Manager and the deceased Championship Manager.

The idea here is to bring a full-fledged experience in eSports, playing major leagues and big championships, managing players, setting up practices and discovering new talents.

In this game, you will be able to set up your team, get them to play in whatever position you would like them to, set up strategies, choose which race/champion/hero they're going to play with, and read match descriptions as they happen live, much like Football Manager on its early days. Managing finances, finding sponsors, boosting your players' morale are also going to play a role in that experience.

## INSTALLATION

I don't have a release build yet, but you can follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-install-the-dependencies-and-start-developing) to learn how to install the project dependencies and run the tests.

## SCREENSHOTS

The UI is being reworked. You can check the `pywebview-ui` branch to see how the work is going.

## HOW TO RUN THE DEBUG VERSION

I have removed the debug version because of the project's rewrite. When the new UI is available, I will update this document
with the new instructions to run the debug build.
